/* @colors
--------------------------------------------------------

  All color variables are defined here.

  We use real color names here.  Although naming something
  like 'brand' is in fact more generic and reusable, we've
  found that you end up creating variables like $brand-2,
  $brand-alt, $brand-complimentary etc.  While coding,
  it's too easy to forget what those mean.

  If the design changes drastically and the brand changes
  from, let's say, blue to green, just do a global
  find/replace - that's what text editors are for.
